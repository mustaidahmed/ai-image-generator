Stable Diffusion 2.1 Image Generator
This project uses Stable Diffusion 2.1 to generate images based on text prompts. It is deployed as a web application using Gradio, making it easy to interact with the model and generate images in real-time.

Features
Generate high-quality images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion 2.1 model.

Simple and intuitive web interface powered by Gradio.

Deployable in Google Colab or any environment with GPU support.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

torch

diffusers

transformers

gradio

matplotlib

scipy

safetensors

xformers

bitsandbytes

You can install all the required libraries using the following commands:

bash
Copy
!pip install --upgrade diffusers transformers accelerate torch bitsandbytes scipy safetensors xformers torchvision
!pip install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
!pip install gradio
How It Works
The Stable Diffusion 2.1 model is loaded using the diffusers library.

A Gradio interface is created to accept text prompts as input.

The model generates an image based on the provided prompt.

The generated image is displayed in the Gradio interface.

Setup and Deployment
1. Running in Google Colab
Open a new Google Colab notebook.

Install the required libraries using the commands above.

Copy and paste the code from this repository into the notebook.

Run the cells to launch the Gradio interface.

Click the Gradio link to open the web app and start generating images.

2. Running Locally
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stable-diffusion-gradio.git
cd stable-diffusion-gradio
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy
python app.py
Open the Gradio link provided in the terminal to access the web app.

Usage
Enter a text prompt in the input box (e.g., "a dragon attacking a village").

Click Submit to generate the image.

The generated image will be displayed in the output section.

Example Prompts
Here are some example prompts you can try:

"a futuristic cityscape at night with neon lights"

"a serene mountain landscape with a flowing river"

"a dragon attacking a medieval village"

"an astronaut exploring an alien planet"


Customization
Model: You can switch to a different version of Stable Diffusion (e.g., Stable Diffusion XL) by changing the model_id in the code.

Guidance Scale: Adjust the guidance_scale parameter in the generate_image function to control the balance between creativity and adherence to the prompt.

Inference Steps: Modify the number of inference steps for higher-quality images (at the cost of slower generation).

Limitations
The model may generate unexpected or low-quality images for ambiguous or overly complex prompts.

Generating high-resolution images requires significant GPU memory.
